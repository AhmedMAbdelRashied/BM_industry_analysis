      \ comprehensive analysis of the (Oil Refining & Extraction)\n\n        ### Introduction\
      \ and Importance\n\n            1. General Overview of the Oil Industry:\n \
      \             Fats, which are widespread in both the plant and animal worlds,\
      \ are a major source of concentrated energy, providing double the energy produced\
      \ by equal amounts of proteins or carbohydrates. Thus, fats are a crucial dietary\
      \ source for humans.\n              Many important industries rely on fats,\
      \ such as oil extraction and refining from plant and animal sources, hydrogenated\
      \ oil production for margarine and cooking oils, as well as diverse industries\
      \ such as soap manufacturing, varnishes, glycerides, and the separation of glycerin\
      \ and fatty acids for other industrial uses.\n              Due to the significance\
      \ of fats, they hold a prominent place in the economies of major countries,\
      \ which focus on the development of their plant and animal sources, whether\
      \ terrestrial or marine, while enhancing extraction and manufacturing processes\
      \ to high-quality standards.\n              The Arab world is rich in important\
      \ natural sources of oils and fats, such as olives, cotton seeds, sesame, sunflower,\
      \ and soybeans. The vegetable oil industry is one of the most significant and\
      \ ancient industries in most countries, having been known to the Mediterranean\
      \ civilizations, particularly in the extraction of olive oil.\n\n          \
      \    Two types of fats exist in nature:\n\n              Animal fats:\n    \
      \          These are derived from animal origins and can be greasy, fatty, or\
      \ oily, depending on their melting points. Greases are solid fats at room temperature,\
      \ while oils are liquid at the same temperature, and fats fall between the two.\n\
      \              Beef and sheep fats are commercially viable sources, and significant\
      \ amounts of oils can be extracted from marine fish and whales, which were historically\
      \ hunted for their oils alone but are now utilized more comprehensively.\n \
      \             Statistics indicate a rising production of animal fats, especially\
      \ in recent years, including butter, animal fats, and fish and whale oils.\n\
      \n              Vegetable fats:\n              There are over 100 types of raw\
      \ plant materials used for oil production today, with annual plants being the\
      \ primary source. Examples include sunflower, corn, sesame, cottonseed, soybeans,\
      \ and peanuts. Perennial trees like coconut, palm, and olive trees serve as\
      \ secondary sources.\n              Notably, plants with oilseeds, such as corn,\
      \ rice, and cotton, yield oil as a secondary product.\n              The following\
      \ table shows the approximate oil content in some seeds and oil-bearing fruits:\n\
      \n              Raw Material\t%\tRaw Material\t%\n              Castor seeds\t\
      40-50\tTobacco seed\t30-43\n              Cottonseed\t15-20\tSafflower seed\t\

      \              Soybean\t18-20\tOlive stone\t10-15\n              Sesame seed\t\
      40-50\tCoconut fruit\t40-65\n              Sunflower seeds\t25-45\tCorn seeds\t\
      17-20\n\n              Vegetable oils are present in all parts of oil-bearing\
      \ plants, including the stem, leaves, roots, flowers, and fruits, although fruits\
      \ contain the highest percentage of fats. It is believed that the Chinese were\
      \ the first to use oil thousands of years ago, employing methods similar to\
      \ modern extraction techniques.\n\n              2. Overview of Soybean Oil\
      \ Industry:\n              Soybean oil is a vegetable oil extracted from soybeans\
      \ (scientifically known as Glycine max). It is one of the most widely used vegetable\
      \ oils and is beneficial due to its essential fatty acids, which contribute\
      \ to overall health. It is also rich in plant sterols, which positively affect\
      \ individual health, and contains a wealth of vitamins and minerals.\n     \
      \         The health benefits of soybean oil include:\n\n              Cholesterol\
      \ control: The high levels of fatty acids in soybean oil help regulate blood\
      \ cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of diseases associated with high cholesterol,\
      \ such as heart disease, strokes, and heart attacks. Fatty acids like palmitic\
      \ acid and oleic acid are present in balanced quantities, helping to lower the\
      \ risk of cardiovascular disease.\n              Alzheimer's disease: Soybean\
      \ oil contains high levels of Vitamin K, which is linked to reducing Alzheimer's\
      \ symptoms, acting as an antioxidant to protect nerve cells from damage.\n \
      \             Bone health: Vitamin K in soybean oil stimulates bone growth and\
      \ speeds up healing from injuries, and its calcium content helps reduce the\
      \ risk of osteoporosis, especially in old age.\n              Skin and eye health:\
      \ Omega-3 fatty acids in soybean oil protect cell membranes in delicate areas\
      \ such as the eyes and skin, preventing bacteria and pollutants from entering.\
      \ It also enhances vision by reducing free radicals, which contribute to macular\
      \ degeneration and cataracts.\n              Improved appearance and overall\
      \ health: The high Vitamin E content in soybean oil reduces acne and prevents\
      \ sunburns. It also helps build new cells and reduces the risk of cancer, heart\
      \ disease, and aging.\n                  \n                - note that today's\

    prompt: "\n        Generate the following section in [language]\n        ### SWOT\
      \ Analysis\n            - Create a detailed table for SWOT analysis for the\
      \ oil extraction and refining industry in Egypt, highlighting its strengths,\
      \ weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.\n            - Be specific and accurate.\n\
      \        ###Industry Characteristics Analysis:\n\n           - Create a table\
      \ of the following elements:\n              Maturity: The industry is in a mature\
      \ phase, characterized by moderate risk. It is closely linked to the food sector,\
      \ with increasing demand for its products each year. The industry benefits from\
      \ Egypt's competitive advantages, such as lower energy and labor costs, making\
      \ it attractive to investors. The continuous population growth is expected to\
      \ further drive demand.\n\n              Cost Structure: The industry exhibits\
      \ low risk in terms of cost structure. It primarily consists of variable costs,\
      \ which constitute the majority of total expenses. This allows for flexibility\
      \ in adjusting to fluctuations in demand.\n\n              Cyclicality: Classified\
      \ as non-cyclical, the industry carries a low risk concerning economic cycles.\
      \ The demand for food is generally stable and not significantly affected by\
      \ changes in economic conditions, although the prices of some raw materials\
      \ may fluctuate due to economic cycles.\n\n              Dependence: There is\
      \ a moderate risk associated with dependence. The sector relies on the availability\
      \ of essential commodities, such as wheat and corn, sourced from both local\
      \ markets and imports. As these goods are fundamental to daily life and are\
      \ used in various food industries, like bread production, their demand remains\
      \ consistently high. Additionally, government efforts to ensure affordable access\
      \ to these products and accommodate population growth bolster their necessity.\n\
      \n              Substitutes: The risk is low in terms of substitutes, as there\
      \ are no alternatives to strategic goods, which are essential for everyday living.\n\
      \n              Regulations: The regulatory environment poses moderate risk.\
      \ The government actively supports the industry by launching projects to expand\
      \ agricultural areas and boost the production of strategic goods. The industry\
      \ is closely monitored to maintain market stability, meet consumption needs,\
      \ and regulate prices, ensuring they remain accessible to consumers.\n\n   \
      \           Profitability: Profitability carries a moderate risk. The industry\
      \ is considered highly profitable because it significantly adds value by converting\
      \ low-cost raw materials into high-value finished products.\n\n\n        ###\
      \ Conclusion\n            - Provide a comprehensive analysis for oils ectraction\
      \ and refining industry trends, highlighting whether each industry is growing\
      \ or declining. Include relevant statistics and data to support your conclusions,\
      \ tailored specifically for credit decision reviewers.\n        - note that\

      \  ### The amount of Egypt’s production of sugar from cane sugar\n         \
      \           ### The amount of Egypt’s production of sugar from beet\n      \
      \                      Integrated Industries targets a 50% increase in beet\
      \ sugar production\n                            Salah Omar: Payment of one billion\
      \ pounds, the value of 450 thousand tons received in {current_year}\n      \
      \                      Integrated Industries targets a 50% increase in beet\
      \ sugar production from one of the sugar factories\n                       \
      \     The Sugar and Integrated Industries Company aims to produce about 110,000\
      \ tons of sugar from beets during the new {current_year_p_1} season, an increase\
      \ of 50% over the {current_year} season, which witnessed the production of 56,000\
      \ tons, according to Engineer Salah Omar, the technical managing director of\
      \ the company.\n                            Omar added in statements to Hapi\
      \ newspaper that the company aims to receive 700 to 800 thousand tons of beets\
      \ from farmers in the governorates of Beni Suef, Minya, Assiut, Sohag, and Qena,\
      \ for the benefit of the Abu Qurqas factory, during the new supply season.\n\
      \                            He pointed out that the company received during\
      \ the {current_year} beet harvest season a quantity amounting to 450 thousand\
      \ tons, and about one billion pounds were paid for the value of the quantities\
      \ supplied.\n                            Omar explained that these quantities\
      \ did not achieve the target estimated at about 600 thousand tons, out of the\
      \ total cultivated area, which amounted to 22 thousand acres.\n            \
      \                He continued that the beet crop that the company obtains through\
      \ the Abu Qurqas factory, 90% of which is contract cultivation and the rest\
      \ is agreed upon through the farmers, noting that there are many advantages\
      \ that are offered and vary from one season to another, according to the competition\
      \ that takes place between different companies, whether governmental or sector.\
      \ private.   \n                            The Technical Managing Director of\
      \ the Sugar Company indicated that the quantities of beets grown in Upper Egypt\
      \ are directed to the Abu Qurqas Factory “government” and the Canal Sugar Company\
      \ Factory “private sector,” noting that the Abu Qurqas Factory received about\
      \ 430 thousand tons of beets during the {current_year} season, It is less than\
      \ the target by about 150 thousand tons, as a result of climate change.\n  \
      \                          It is noteworthy that Egypt produces about 2.7 million\
      \ sugar, of which the sugar company’s share is 700 thousand tons and the rest\
      \ is from beet companies. The consumption rate is about 3 million tons of sugar,\
      \ and 300 thousand tons are imported to fill the gap between production and\
      \ consumption.                    \n                    ### Amount Egypt's imports\
      \ of sugar\n                            A report by the US Department of Agriculture\
      \ expects Egypt's sugar production to decline during the new {current_year}-{current_year_p_1}\
      \ season to record 2.86 million tons, down 110.2 thousand tons compared to the\
      \ ministry's previous expectations due to the decline in sugarcane production.\n\
      \                            A recent report by the US Department of Agriculture\
      \ said that last year witnessed a decline in global sugar production, as sugar\
      \ prices rose and the pound recorded a new decline, which limited the possibility\
      \ of Egypt importing sugar.\n                            During the past year,\
      \ Egypt suffered a crisis of a sharp rise in free sugar prices, with the price\
      \ of a kilo reaching 50 pounds ($1.02), before it declined again and became\
      \ available in the markets at lower prices.\n                            Inflation\
      \ in Egypt hit record levels last year, reaching 38 percent in September, before\
      \ declining again.\n\n                            Although Egypt has expanded\
      \ its sugar beet and cane cultivation, its production is not enough for its\
      \ consumption and it is imported from abroad.\n\n                          \
      \  Sugar consumption in Egypt increases\n                            The report\
      \ expects Egypt's sugar consumption to increase during the new season {current_year}/{current_year_p_1}\
      \ to reach 4.1 million tons compared to 3.9 million tons in the previous season,\
      \ due to population growth and increased demand for sugar.\n               \
      \             Egypt is one of the highest sugar consuming countries in the world.\
      \ According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the\
      \ individual in Egypt consumes 51.4 kilograms of sugar annually, which is nearly\
      \ double the global average consumption per person.\n                      \
      \      Sugar is sold in Egypt at the free price and the subsidized price, and\
      \ those with a support card can obtain subsidized sugar.\n                 \
      \           The report expects Egypt's imports in the new season {current_year}-{current_year_p_1}\
      \ to reach 1.65 million tons, an increase of 551 thousand tons over the previous\
      \ season {current_year_m_1}-{current_year}, to cover the shortage in local production\
      \ and the increase in demand.\n                            Egypt primarily imports\
      \ raw sugar cane from Brazil and raw sugar beets from the European Union.\n\
      \                            Market fluctuations in the fiscal year {current_year_m_1}-{current_year}\
      \ led the General Authority for Supply Commodities to purchase raw and refined\
      \ sugar cane from Saudi Arabia.\n                            Egypt's sugar stock\
      \ is estimated to end the new season {current_year}-{current_year_p_1} at nearly\
      \ 1.1 million tons, an increase of 1.03 million tons over the stock estimates\
      \ in the {current_year_m_1}-{current_year} season, with Egypt establishing a\
      \ strategic reserve to protect against future shocks.\n                    \
      \        Last March, the Egyptian Cabinet announced that Egypt intends to import\
      \ one million tons of white sugar during the current the current year to confront\
      \ rising prices and scarce supply.\n                            The Ministry\
      \ of Supply and Internal Trade, represented by the General Authority for Supply\
      \ Commodities, contracted last April to purchase 200,000 tons of imported raw\
      \ sugar, bringing the total contracted at the time to 450,000 tons of raw sugar.\
      \              \n                    ### Amount Egypt's exports of sugar\n \

      \ introduction about the textiles industry:\n             Textile and Garment\
      \ Industry\n            The textile and ready-made garment sector is the only\
      \ vertically integrated industrial sector in Egypt in the Middle East, where\
      \ the journey of final textile products begins with the cultivation of the finest\
      \ Egyptian cotton known for its quality worldwide, through the production of\
      \ yarn, dyeing, finishing, printing, then knitting, packaging and final packaging\
      \ of the product with high quality that competes with global products, which\
      \ has placed Egypt among the 60 largest exporting countries of textiles and\
      \ clothing in the world. The sector includes a number of sub-sectors: spinning,\
      \ fabrics, ready-made garments and home textiles. The ready-made garments sub-sector\
      \ represents more than 70% of the entire sector in Egypt, and provides more\
      \ than 20% of job opportunities in the Egyptian labor market. The textile industry\
      \ is one of the important sectors in the Egyptian economy, employing approximately\
      \ 20% of the industrial workforce in Egypt, and representing 16% of industrial\
      \ exports.\n\n            Spinning and weaving:\n            The number of factories\
      \ operating in the sector reached 11,000\n\n            Ready-made garments:\n\
      \            Ready-made garments represent 70% of the total sector, and provide\
      \ 20% of the job opportunities provided by the textile sector. The number of\
      \ factories operating in ready-made garments reached 3,169\n\n            Home\
